I am a Research Fellow in Cancer Services and Data Science at the University of Melbourne and VCCC. In My research focuses on applications of machine learning and statistical methods to linked health services data in order to improve cancer outcomes.

This blog relates more to general tech, programming and data topics, rather than academia - just a place to record some interesting things I have learned. Hopefully some of these articles will be useful for others too. 

My background is in maths and physics and I completed my PhD back in 2015. Since then I have worked in a range of data science roles, working in the areas of signal processing, geospatial analysis and over the past few years, clinical data science. My main interests are in clinical data science, machine learning and statistics.

A github project I'm currently developing

- [Whereabouts](https://github.com/ajl2718/whereabouts): a fast open-source geocoding package built using Python and DuckDB that can be run in your own environment.


Some other things I like: mountains; cycling; middle-eastern cooking experiments and anything involving eggplant; reading; and music.
